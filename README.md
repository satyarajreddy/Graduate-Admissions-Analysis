## **Project Description**
- Use the dataset to predict the chances of Indian students getting an admit by an US university for Graduate program.
- The prediction is based on several academic performance indices of the student.
- The project discusses steps such as data exploration, data preprocessing, correlation, etc. to train Machine Learning models, make prediction and assess their performance.


## **Data Source(s)**
- The dataset being used in the project has been sourced from A Comparison of Regression Models for Prediction of Graduate Admissions, IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Data Science 2019. 
- Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions.
- The dataset contains various academic parameters based on which the studentâ€™s profile is evaluated.


## **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
### *The input variables are:*
- GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
- TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
- University Rating ( out of 5 )
- Strength of Statement of Purpose ( out of 5 )
- Strength of Letter of Recommendation ( out of 5 )
- Undergraduate CGPA ( out of 10 )
- Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
### *The output variable is:*
- Chance of Admit 

## **Modelling**
### *The below models were developed:*
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- KNN
- Neural Network 
- Ensembling: Logistic and KNN with Averaging
